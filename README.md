My very bad solutions for [Advent of Code 2021] in [Racket]. Don't look if you
don't want spoilers.

## Organisation

Each day is in its own folder, so solutions for day 2 are in `day2` folder, for
day 3 are in `day3` folder and so on. Along with each day are the sample inputs
and the puzzle inputs for each part (or only one if the input didn't change).
